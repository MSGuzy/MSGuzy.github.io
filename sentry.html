            <p>As the sole designer at Sentry Data Systems, I developed the Sentry Data Systems Product Manager Design System to streamline the design process for product managers and improve the consistency and professionalism of the company's product designs. This Figma library provides a set of pre-designed, customizable components and design patterns that product managers can use to create cohesive, high-quality designs without the need for extensive design expertise.</p>

            <h2>Features:</h2>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>A library of pre-designed components tailored to the specific needs of Sentry's products, including buttons, forms, navigation elements, and more</li>
                <li>
                    Customizable styles for each component, including color, typography, and spacing options that align with Sentry's branding guidelines</li>
                <li>Pre-defined design patterns for common UI elements, such as lists and tables, that meet the needs of Sentry's products</li>
                <li>Responsive design support for a range of screen sizes and devices</li>
                <li>Easy integration with existing Figma projects within the Sentry Data Systems organization</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits:</h2>
            <ul class="bullets">
